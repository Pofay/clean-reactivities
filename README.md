# Reactivities Application

This is my output on following along this [Udemy course using .NET Core, React and MobX][1]

The `master` contains the code that deviates only a little from what is shown in the course (For learning Purposes)

Also serves as both a refresher for .NET and its new features.

If you want to see the codebase with these changes below then you should visit the `adjusted` branch

- T.D.D some parts of the application
- Using Repositories and Interactor classes
- Removal of the usage Mediatr in some parts of the code.
- Using Redux instead of Mobx on the client code
- Using Plain SQL Reads on Certain Queries (Bypassing Domain Layer)
