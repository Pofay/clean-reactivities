# Reactivities Application

This is my output on following along this [Udemy course using .NET Core, React and MobX][1]

Also serves as both a refresher for .NET and its new features.

Later on I'm going to adjust the codebase to fit my architectural standards:

- T.D.D some parts of the application
- Using Repositories and Interactor classes
- Removal of the usage Mediatr in some parts of the code.
- Using Redux instead of Mobx on the client code
- Using Plain SQL Reads on Certain Queries (Bypassing Domain Layer)
