# Reactivities Application

This is my output on following along this [Udemy course using .NET Core, React and MobX][1]

This `adjusted` branch contains the code that deviates a lot from the main source of the tutorial to do the things listed below:

- T.D.D some parts of the application
- Using Repositories and Interactor classes
- Removal of the usage Mediatr in some parts of the code.
- Using Redux instead of Mobx on the client code
- Using Plain SQL Reads on Certain Queries (Bypassing Domain Layer)

In case you want to check out the original code then visit the `master` branch of this repository.
