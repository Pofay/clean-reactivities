# Reactivities Application

This is my output on following along this [Udemy course using .NET Core, React and MobX][1]

The `master` contains the code that deviates only a little from what is shown in the course as this serves both a refresher for .NET and its new features.

Aside from that I do have other learning goals in mind:

- ~~T.D.D some parts of the application~~ Get acquainted with Cypress to Test (and possibly refactor?) the UI.
- Using Repositories and Unit of Work with EntityFramework
- Removing Mediator and instead use plain Interactor classes.
- ~~Using Redux instead of Mobx on the client code~~ First foray on the usage of React Query for page queries and replacing MobX with Redux.
- Making custom hooks
- Using Plain SQL Reads on Certain Queries (Bypassing Domain Layer)


I do have some plans for this repository to mimic the [RealWorld][2] in that the application will function in the same way regardless if you swap the backend or frontend with something different.
